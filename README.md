# Fondamenti-di-Automatica
This repository contains the exercises for the "Fondamenti di Automatica" course, part of the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at @Units.

Educational Objectives
The educational objective of the course is to provide students with the basic elements of dynamic systems theory, both in continuous time and discrete time, and some fundamentals of control system design, with particular reference to engineering application contexts.

Prerequisites
Elements of mathematical analysis, with particular reference to the study of differential equations, fundamentals of functions of a complex variable, and elements of linear algebra.

Program
Introduction to Control Problems.

Purpose of automatic control.
Examples of control problems in engineering.
Performance of control systems (transient and steady-state).
Types and components of control systems (open loop, closed loop, compensation, regulators, transducers, actuators).
Definition of discrete-time signal and motivations for using discrete-time controllers.
Dynamic Models.

Continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems: temporal models and transfer functions, superposition of effects, and stability.
Step response (with particular reference to first and second-order systems), block diagrams.
Non-linear systems: linearization around an equilibrium state, stability of equilibrium.
Mathematical description of some continuous-time and discrete-time processes in engineering.
Frequency Response.

Definition and properties of frequency response, connections with the transfer function.
Representation using polar and Bode diagrams.
Relationships between frequency response and time responses.
Interpretation of dynamic systems as filters.
Sampled-Data Systems.

Sampling, aliasing, choice of sampling period.
Approximate continuous-to-discrete conversion techniques: "implicit Euler" method, Tustin transform.
Control Systems Analysis and Design.

Requirements of control systems: stability, accuracy (steady-state error, speed, and overshoot), disturbance insensitivity, robustness.
Stability analysis of control systems: Nyquist and Bode criteria.
Performance analysis of control systems and their dependence on the open-loop transfer function.
Continuous-time regulator design based on Bode criterion.
